    <h1>Who are we?</h1>

       music fun! We specialise in themed earbuds, from cult classics to the deep
       sea, all with a retro twist, to make your music experience anything but 
       basic! Show of your style with a original pair of ear-buds which match 
       your vibe! <br><br>Our goal is to make you move to the music whilst moving 
       <em>with </em> your music!

      <h2>Retrofuturism</h2>
      <p>What is retrofutrism? Well weâ€™ll tell you now! <br> <br>
        Retrofutrisim is the way we used to see the future, cool right? <br>
        We were really inspired by the way we used to see the future during the 
        50s, 60s and 70s and thought that it would make an awesome design to 
        wear in your ears!<br>
       <em class="parenthesis">(Our team of designers just watched back to the future and thought it 
       was a good idea)</em>
